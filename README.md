## Basics

- Go is a statically typed, compiled programming language.
- All source files in a directory must share the same package name.
- When a package is imported, only entities whose names start with a capital letter can be used / accessed.
- Variables can be defined by explicitly specifying a type.
- You can also use an initializer, and the compiler will assign the variable type to match the type of the initializer.
- Constants are defined using the `const`.
- Go functions accept zero or more parameters.
    - Parameters must be explicitly typed, there is no type inference.
- Values are returned from functions using the `return` keyword.

## Comments

Go supports two types of comments:
    - Single line comments are preceded by `//`.
    - Multiline comments are inserted between `/*` and `*/`.
